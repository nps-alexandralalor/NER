# To take data from excel files and save individual protocols/tabs as CSVs,
# and name them appropriately

# Folder Setup:
# Navigate to where you store FX excel data files (e.g. data/GRCA/FMH/2023/Collected/)
# In this folder, create a folder called "_CSV_Import to FFI"
# Put all your completed data collection excel spreadsheets into the "Collected" folder.
#   Make sure excel files are named as follows: MonitoringType_Plot#_Status (e.g. PIPN_08_02Year05.xlsx)
# The "_CSV_Import to FFI" folder should be empty. This is where CSVs will be stored after running this code.
