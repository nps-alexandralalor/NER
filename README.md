# Purpose

This code is in support of the NPS Northeast Region Fire Effects Monitoring program.

# File Structure

This repository contains 2 main files, the "scripts" file and the "output" file.

Note: [Data]{.underline} is stored on the N Drive (SHEN shared drive) at this file location:

-   "N:RAD\\Fire\\Fire Mgmt\\FIRE_ECOLOGIST_FILES\\FFI Data Management\\Exports from FFI\\NER"

## scripts

The scripts file contains all code. It may contain sub folders for organization, which separate the code by tasks

### Clean

If FFI outputs are not suitable, use this code to clean them up

### Field

Scripts related to field work (e.g. prepping data for import/export)

### QAQC

Scripts related to Quality Control and Quality Assurance

### Viz

Scripts to visualize datasets

### Analysis

Scripts to analyze datasets

## output

The output file contains any output from the code itself. These can be recreated by running to correct script. Examples of relevant output files are shown below, although there could be more or less. These files are displayed on GitHub, but the contents are not uploaded or backed up. Final versions of these outputs should be saved to a different file structure rather than stored on GitHub. Instead, use this output file to store temporary outputs.

-   data_clean
-   errors
-   graphs
-   etc
